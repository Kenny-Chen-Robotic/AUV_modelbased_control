# Introduction
Realization of model-based controller of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). 

Part1: Dynamic / kinematic modelling of AUV.
Part2: Design of closed-loop controller, including pole assignment method, linear quadratic regulator (LQR) and sliding mode controller (SMC).
Part3: Deployment and validation of controller. (omit)

The package provides simulation codes and the summary report. Simulation result could be reshowed easily by following these steps in document.
